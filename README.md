Here are a few of my essential dot files. I will be slowly automating the installation of dependencies and making these more portable.
##Install
Clone repo and then run make to install. The makefile forcibly symlinks the dotfiles in this directory to the home directory. Will eventually replace this make file with a shell script that automatically backs up existing dot files and builds and retrieves all dependencies and factors in the operating system
